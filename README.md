# FunApp #

The FunApp application is a portal where you can register, create your profile (which includes a photo and name). With the help of imgflip Api, we can create our own memes, publish them on our page (they will be visible to other users).
We can view and follow other users' profiles.
We have two meme feeds. The first feed consists of memes created by users you follow, and the second is popular memes (popularity is determined by the number of likes on a post)
As for a specific meme, we can like it, save it to favorites, or write a comment (comments can also be liked).
We can edit our profile data (photo and name)
